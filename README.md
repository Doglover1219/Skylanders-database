# Skylanders Database

This repository hosts a large database with tons of information about Skylanders.

## The Search Feature

The database is equipped with a search bar to search for every Skylander, Game, Element, and Battle Classe in the database by name.

It is also equipped with a sort feature, and a filter feature, to make life maybe a bit easier sometimes?

## Stored Information

There is a lot of information on almost every Skylander in Skylanders (excluding Chase Variants).

And not *only* Skylanders, but also the 6 mainline console Skylanders Games, the 10 elements, and the 10 Battle Classes.
